Hello everyone , this is the online version of simons game
in which players need to remember the color pattern and repeat
it by pressing the colored buttons on the game unit in the correct
order. It starts off at a nice steady pace, but the more you play, 
the more complicated the patterns become, building suspense with each 
turn. 
It can boost your memory power.
I have created it using html,css,javascript
